# Covid19-Data-Extractor-WHO

`
Retrieves Covid-19 Updates from api.covid19india.org API and creates excel sheet for state and district wise timeline data
`

This is a personal project to help WHO employees to get data automatically. You need to select the state from the dropdown and click on submit. You will get an excel sheet for downloading and that will contain the data of the state selected and all the districts, if any, in that state in different sheets in the file.

The data is extracted from https://www.covid19india.org. This website has its own API, https://api.covid19india.org. The API contains state-wise, district-wise and whole country's COVID19 data with dates. The excel sheet is generated using this data.
